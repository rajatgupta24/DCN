## Experiment 4
### Aim:
Create a Straight Cable & Crossover Cable using RJ45 Connector.

### RJ45 Connectors:

**RJ**: Registered Jack (RJ) is a standardized network interface for connecting voice and data telecommunications equipment.

RJ45 is newer, modular, self-securing and compact technology used for connecting the ethernet cables to different electronic devices. The RJ45 is an 8 pin connector used to attach the ethernet interfaces. It is known as an 8P8C connector.

Types of cables based on the termination:

- Straight-over cable
- Crossover cable

It is a widely used type of registered jack connector in Ethernet cables or network devices. It is similar to the telephone jack or connector for sharing the data over the local area network. The shape of RJ45 cable or Ethernet cable is wider than the telephone jack.

It is used to create a connection with both shielded twisted pair (STP) and unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling in the star topology of the Ethernet network. RJ45 connectors are usually with 8P8C that means eight positions, eight contacts modular connectors with separate twisted pair for connecting computer and telephone lines, wall plates, patch panels and other networking devices.

### Straight Cables

A straight through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes called a patch cable and is an alternative to wireless connections where one or more computers access a router through a wireless signal. On a straight through cable, the wired pins match.

Straight through cable use one wiring standard: both ends use T568A wiring standard or both ends use T568B wiring standard. The following figure shows a straight through cable of which both ends are wired as the T568B standard.

### Crossover Cables

An Ethernet crossover cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly. Unlike straight through cable, crossover cables use two different wiring standards: one end uses the T568A wiring standard, and the other end uses the T568B wiring standard. The internal wiring of Ethernet crossover cables reverses the transmit and receive signals. It is most often used to connect two devices of the same type: e.g. two computers (via network interface controller) or two switches to each other.
